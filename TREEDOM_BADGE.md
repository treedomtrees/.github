Usually you would want to embed the badge in your `README.md` file. You can do that by following the steps below.

## Forest Badge

You can also embed a badge for a forest:
1. Create an account on [treedom.net](https://www.treedom.net)
2. Create a [new forest](https://www.treedom.net/en/forest/create) and select the option "Who can plant in the forest: __Everyone__"
3. Customize your forest with a nice background and choose a name: remember that it will be used to generate its permanent URL "slug".
4. Publish the forest and copy the forest "slug" from the URL: ../en/user/treedom/event/__my-forest-slug__
5. Embed the badge in your `README.md` file using the following code:

```md
[![Plant a Tree](https://badges.treedom.net/badge/f/my-forest-slug)](https://treedom.net/forest/my-forest-slug)
```

## Personal account Badge
1. Create an account on [treedom.net](https://treedom.net)
1. Embed the badge in your `README.md` file using the following code:

 ```md
 [![Plant a Tree](https://badges.treedom.net/badge/u/your-username)](https://treedom.net/your-username)
 ```

1. Make sure you replace `your-username` with your username on treedom.net

## Organization / Business account Badge

# We Love Open Source
Treedom is a platform that allows anyone to plant trees in different countries around the world... and we also love open source! We usually develop our projects using a lot of great open-source tools like NodeJS, GraphQL, React, Terraform, CDK, OPAL, Kubernetes, and more. We are committed to improving our software and architectures every day, and sometimes we need to build libraries that don't yet exist or donâ€™t perfectly fit our needs.

Treedom has recently decided to open-source some of our libraries that could be useful to other developers. We are launching a dedicated project to support and maintain these libraries with the help of the community.

Take a look at our [repositories list](https://github.com/orgs/treedomtrees/repositories). If you find any project you would like to collaborate on, please feel free to contact us.

# The "Plant a Tree" Badge

With this badge, you can feature either your personal Treedom account or a forest where people can plant trees.
